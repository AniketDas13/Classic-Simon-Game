# Classic-Simon-Game
A fun website that imitates the Classic Simon Game, made using HTML, CSS, JS &amp; jQuery
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Rules are simple:
Start the game by pressing any key on the keyboard.
Firstly, the game shows the first colour in the sequence, let's say blue. The user clicks on the blue button.
Next, the game shows the next colour, say red, the user has to remember the sequence that is blue, red and so on and so forth.
If the user messes up the sequence, then the game ends.
Enjoy!
